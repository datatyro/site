## 2.Python
* There is no shortage of Python tutorials in the world. The [official one](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is not a bad place to start.

* The [official IPython tutorial](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/index.html) will help you get started with IPython, if you decide to use it. Please use it.

* The [mypy documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) will tell you more than you ever wanted to know about Python type annotations and type checking.

## 3.Visualizing Data
* The [matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) will give you a good idea of the sorts of things you can do with matplotlib (and how to do them).

* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is built on top of matplotlib and allows you to easily produce prettier (and more complex) visualizations.

* [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a newer Python library for creating declarative visualizations.

* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library for producing sophisticated interactive visualizations for the web. Although it is not in Python, it is widely used, and it is well worth your while to be familiar with it.

* [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) is a library that brings D3-style visualizations into Python.

## 4.Linear Algebra
* Linear algebra is widely used by data scientists (frequently implicitly, and not infrequently by people who don’t understand it). It wouldn’t be a bad idea to read a textbook. You can find several freely available online:

    * [Linear Algebra](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/), by Jim Hefferon (Saint Michael’s College)

    * [Linear Algebra](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/linear-guest.pdf), by David Cherney, Tom Denton, Rohit Thomas, and Andrew Waldron (UC Davis)

    * If you are feeling adventurous, [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW_2017-09-04.pdf), by Sergei Treil (Brown University), is a more advanced introduction.

* All of the machinery we built in this chapter you get for free if you use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). (You get a lot more too, including much better performance.)

## 5.Statistics
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [StatsModels](http://www.statsmodels.org/) all come with a wide variety of statistical functions.

* Statistics is *important*. (Or maybe statistics are important?) If you want to be a better data scientist, it would be a good idea to read a statistics textbook. Many are freely available online, including:

    * [Introductory Statistics](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/introductory-statistics), by Douglas Shafer and Zhiyi Zhang (Saylor Foundation)

    * [OnlineStatBook](http://onlinestatbook.com/), by David Lane (Rice University)

    * [Introductory Statistics](https://openstax.org/details/introductory-statistics), by OpenStax (OpenStax College)

## 6.Probability
* [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) contains PDF and CDF functions for most of the popular probability distributions.

* Remember how, at the end of Chapter 5, I said that it would be a good idea to study a statistics textbook? It would also be a good idea to study a probability textbook. The best one I know that’s available online is [Introduction to Probability](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html), by Charles M. Grinstead and J. Laurie Snell (American Mathematical Society).
